    <div id='intro'>
        <p>This is an HTML5-based online client for the event. It requires no configuration and can be played in most of the modern browsers.</p>

        <p>There is only one thing that you have to provide on your own, and that's the English ROM of Pok&eacute;mon Yellow (not included here, because of the copyright issues). Once you select the proper ROM, a JavaScript-based GBC emulator will start, the event save file will be automatically loaded, and an emulated link cable connection will be estabilished with the event servers. <u>You will be logged in using the current account on the event site</u> (<b><script>
            document.write(localStorage['d_username']);
        </script></b>).</p>

        <p>Controls: Z for the A button, S or X for the B button, Enter for the Start button, Space for the Select button, arrow keys as the D-Pad.</p>

        <p>Load an English Pok&eacute;mon Yellow ROM to continue:</p>

<script>
    if (localStorage['d_username'] && localStorage['d_sessid']){
        document.getElementById('finp').addEventListener('change', function(e){
            var file = document.getElementById('finp').files[0];
            reader.readAsBinaryString(file);
        });
    }else{
        alert("You are not logged in.");
        window.location = '..';
